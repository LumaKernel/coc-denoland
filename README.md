This repository's goal is porting [`vscode_deno`](https://github.com/denoland/vscode_deno) to `coc.nvim`, so making it less diff.

Versioning policy is perfectly separated from [`vscode_deno`](https://github.com/denoland/vscode_deno) and `deno`.

- As vim plugin install: `npm install`
- `CocInstall coc-denoland`
